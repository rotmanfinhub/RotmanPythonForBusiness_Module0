You also need to install *packages*—pre-written code that other people made so you don't have to reinvent the wheel. (For example, there's a package called `pandas` that makes working with spreadsheet-like data easy.)\n",

When you run `uv sync`, it reads these files and reproduces that exact setup on your machine.\n",
