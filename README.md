|-------|-------------|
| Install uv | Python package manager that handles installation and dependencies |
| Set up VS Code | The IDE where you'll write and run code |
| Clone a repository | Download a project from GitHub |
| Create a virtual environment | Isolated Python setup for this project |
| Run Python code | Execute cells in a Jupyter notebook |
| Save work with Git | Commit and push changes to GitHub |

## Key Concepts

- **uv** — A modern tool that installs Python and manages packages in one command
- **Virtual environment** — A folder (`.venv`) that holds Python and packages for this specific project
- **Repository** — A folder tracked by Git, containing all your project files
- **Jupyter notebook** — Interactive documents (`.ipynb` files) that combine code, text, and output

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `module0_getting_started.ipynb` | Main notebook with setup instructions and exercises |
